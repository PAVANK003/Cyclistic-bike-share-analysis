The data for this case study is publicly available [here](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
The data I used are 2021-02,03,04,05,11,12 months and 2022-01,02,03,04,11,12 months.
Since these datasets are too large, I used Bigquery for analysis. I uploaded these datasets by creating bucket of google cloud storage.
